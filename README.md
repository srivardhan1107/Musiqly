Musiqly is a sleek and responsive web-based music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users explore and play songs from various playlists, each organized into folders with a corresponding songs.json file to manage track listings. The interface features real-time playback controls, a dynamic progress bar, and smooth transitions. Designed with responsiveness in mind, Musiqly works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices — with a collapsible sidebar and adaptive layout for smaller screens. Fully front-end and backend-free, it can be easily deployed on platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages.
